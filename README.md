# HCCO Modpack

This modpack consists of a set of mostly independent mod-scripts, which aims to improve the user interface for HCCO players. Eventually it may open up some restrictions imposed by the game, or perhaps even add some items to reach the endgame.

### Install
There are a set of ways you can install the mods with.

Either use [Melvor Mod Manager](https://github.com/CherryMace/melvor-mod-manager) if you're on Steam. Note that support for this tool may soon end, but should work for now. You can enter the url for this repository directly in there, and it will work.

Otherwise, you may want to use Tampermonkey to insert each script as a mod, if you're playing from a browser.

Check the [Official Wiki for Melvor](https://wiki.melvoridle.com/w/Scripting_and_Extensions_Instructions) for better instructions.
